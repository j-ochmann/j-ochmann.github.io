[**Design pattern**](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A1vrhov%C3%BD_vzor) in software engineering describes a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in a given software design context.[1] A design pattern is not a finished design that can be directly translated into code. It is a description or template of how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.[2] Design patterns can be thought of as formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common software design problems.
