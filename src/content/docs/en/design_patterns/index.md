A [**software design pattern**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) describes a reusable solution to a commonly needed behavior in software.[1] A design pattern is not a rigid structure to be copied directly into source code. Rather, it is a description of and a template for solving a particular type of problem that can be used in many different contexts, including different programming languages and computing platforms.[2] Design patterns can be viewed as formalized best practices that the programmer may use to solve common problems when designing software.
