## Running the test

Try making a small change in some Czech .md file in the src/content/docs/cs/ folder and push it to GitHub.

Watch the Actions tab to see if the script successfully connects to your server.

change in the file

Security `tip': Don't show this key anywhere publicly (it's fine in chat for setup purposes, but never leave it in code on GitHub). GitHub Secrets will hide it so it will only show as *** in the Action log. The GitHub Secrets documentation confirms that this is the most secure path for 2026.
